# intro-data-capstone-biodiversity
I wanted more practice so I also did this project for class. It's essentially my 2nd project ever. So the gist of it:
"For this project, you’ll act as a data analyst for the National Park Service. You’ll be helping them analyze data on endangered species from several different parks.
The National Parks Service would like you to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and to investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data, pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaning way."
