# intro-data-capstone-biodiversity
For this project: you’ll act as a data analyst for the National Park Service. You’ll be helping them analyze data on endangered species from several different parks. The National Parks Service would like you to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and to investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data, pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaning way.
*I realize that some of the slides aren't as minimal as I'd like, but this project had specific items that I had to include on the slides. If this was a presentation for work, I'd go with less is more. I'd probably also have an appendix with the data tests too.
